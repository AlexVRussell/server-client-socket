### Server-Client Socket communication in Java

This project demonstrates a simple multi-threaded client-server system in Java using TCP sockets.
It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and exchange messages concurrently

### How to run for yourself and play around (Easiest in Terminal IMO)

clone the repo.
run `javac main.java server.java client.java`
then `java main` and type "s" to make this instance a server
then you can run as many `java main` in other terminal windows and type "c" to make those instances clients.

Now in the client windows you can type messages and hit enter to see them in the server window!
